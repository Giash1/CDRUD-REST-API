<!-- constructor -->
<!-- // Constructors allow you to initialize the state of an object when it is created. -->

<!-- const Student = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema); -->

<!-- // The Student model is created using the mongoose.model() method, which takes the model name ('Student') and
// the schema definition (studentSchema) as parameters. When you call new Student(),
// it internally uses the constructor provided by Mongoose to create a new instance of the Student model. -->


<!-- service (layer)-->

<!-- By using a service layer, you separate the business logic and data access logic from the route handlers or controllers. This promotes a modular and organized code structure -->

<!-- using a service layer promotes better code organization, reusability, testability, and maintainability in your application.
 -->
<!-- Services can be reused across different parts of your application. For example, if you have multiple routes or controllers that need to perform CRUD operations on a specific model (e.g., Student), you can reuse the studentService methods without duplicating code. -->



<!-- Routes -->

<!--Routes are an essential part of a web application that define the endpoints or URLs that clients can access to perform certain actions or retrieve data.  -->

<!-- Routes help in organizing your application's endpoints and actions in a modular manner. Each route handles a specific HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a particular URL. This separation makes it easier to manage and understand the different functionalities of your application.

 -->



<!-- config.env -->

<!-- The config.env file is used to store environment variables. Environment variables are dynamic values that can be accessed by the application at runtime. These variables can include sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret tokens. By using environment variables stored in config.env, you can separate these sensitive details from your codebase and keep them securely on the server. -->



<!-- dotenv -->

<!-- By using dotenv, you can keep your sensitive or environment-specific configuration values separate from your codebase. This allows for easier configuration management, better security, and improved portability of your application across different environments. Additionally, the dotenv package provides features like parsing boolean or numeric values and supporting multi-line values in the .env file.

 <!-- SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) -->

<!-- SQL: SQL databases follow a rigid, predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including tables, columns, and relationships. Data is organized into rows and columns, and tables are related using primary and foreign keys.

NoSQL: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema or schemaless design. They can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph. -->

<!-- SQL: SQL databases traditionally scale vertically by increasing the hardware resources (e.g., CPU, memory) of a single server. However, some SQL databases also support horizontal scaling through clustering and sharding techniques.

NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. They are built for high-performance and can handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. -->


<!-- Node.js -->

<!-- Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting and building scalable network applications. -->

<!-- Overall, Node.js has gained popularity due to its performance, scalability, and the ability to build fast and efficient network applications using JavaScript on the server-side. It has become a popular choice for developers working on web servers, microservices, real-time applications, and other server-side projects. -->



<!-- Express.js -->

<!-- Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and utilities that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. -->

<!-- Express.js is widely used for building web applications, APIs, and backend services. Its simplicity, flexibility, and large community support have made it a popular choice among developers working with Node.js. It provides a solid foundation for creating scalable, modular, and maintainable web applications. -->

<!-- using router, middlware, end point -->




<!-- mongodb -->
<!-- MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database, MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based managed service for MongoDB, and "MongoPass" refers to a passphrase or password used for authentication and access control in MongoDB deployments. -->


<!-- postman -->

<!-- Postman is widely used by developers, QA testers, and API providers to streamline the API development process, test APIs, and document API functionality. It helps simplify the testing and debugging of APIs by providing a centralized platform for managing API requests and automating tests. -->




<!-- cors -->
<!-- The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) module is a middleware that allows you to enable Cross-Origin requests in your Express application. Cross-Origin requests occur when a web page hosted on one domain makes a request to a server hosted on a different domain. -->
